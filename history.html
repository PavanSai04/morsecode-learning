            <h2>History of Morse Code</h2>
            <p>Morse code was developed in the early 1830s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail. It was initially created for telegraphy, allowing long-distance communication using a series of dots and dashes to represent letters and numbers.</p>
            <p>The first message sent using Morse code was "What hath God wrought," transmitted on May 24, 1844, from Washington, D.C., to Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
            <p>Morse code played a crucial role in maritime communication and was widely used until the late 20th century when it was gradually replaced by more advanced digital communication methods.</p>
            <p>Despite its decline in everyday use, Morse code remains a significant part of communication history and is still used in aviation and amateur radio.</p>
            <p>Today, Morse code is often taught as a skill for emergency situations and is appreciated for its simplicity and effectiveness in conveying messages over long distances.</p>
